Our official kick-off meeting was successfully held in beautiful Avíla, Spain. Here, 9 participants representing all project partners meet for four days and discussed ideas, working methods, data sharing, time lines and cooperation within the FreshRestore project. We also managed to take a fieldtrip to one of the lakes in Spain that is part of the sampling scheme for stable isotopes within the project. Here, we were also got direct insight in the potential effects of climate changes of freshwaters, as we were guided by a local researcher holding an impressive time series of water chemistry and temperature of the lake. We also squeezed in some nice social dinners and lunches, enjoying the Spanish climate and hospitality. To keep it short, the kick-off was a fruitful and great experience.
