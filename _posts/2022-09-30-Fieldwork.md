Exsiting times! This autumn the Spanish partners, lead by [Javier](https://kimmagnusb.github.io/FreshRestore/team/#Javier+S%C3%A1nchez+Hern%C3%A1ndez), did a great job in field and were able to collect stable isotope samples from three different lakes in Spain.
These new samples will shed light on food web structure and energy flow within the systems, knowledge that is currently non-existing for these lakes and systems. It will be existing to put the data collected into a bigger transnational context, and compare with similar systems in Fenoscandia to help disentangle effects of climate change and other anthropogenic effects on the ecology.
