This autumn the Spanish partners in FreshRestore, lead by [Javier](https://kimmagnusb.github.io/FreshRestore/team/#Javier+S%C3%A1nchez+Hern%C3%A1ndez), did a great job in field and were able to collect stable isotope samples from three different lakes in Spain: Sanabria lake, Grande de Gredos lake and Cimera lake. 
These new samples will shed light on food web structure and energy flow within the systems, knowledge that is currently non-existing for these lakes. It will be existing to put the data collected into a bigger transnational context, and compare with similar systems in Fenoscandia to help disentangle effects of climate change and other anthropogenic effects on the ecology.
