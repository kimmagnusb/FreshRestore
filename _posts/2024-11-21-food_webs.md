Several FreshRestore partners contributed to a recently published review paper describing the environmental and anthropogenic drivers of food webs and fish populations in cold-water lakes situated in high latitudes and altitudes.  
Drawing on a synthesis of existing literature, the paper focuses on three pivotal drivers:  
1. Lake location and connectivity  
2. Lake area and morphometry  
3. Fish community composition  

These drivers significantly influence the complexity and the origin and flow of energy in lake food webs, and ultimately the size structure of the charr and trout populations. Furthermore, the paper highlights ongoing environmental changes in Fennoscandian cold-water lakes caused by hydropower and invasive species. Finally, the paper identifies crucial knowledge gaps and proposes management actions for improving the future state of Fennoscandian cold-water lake ecosystems and their charr and trout populations.

  <p><i>A schematic illustration of the main environmental drivers affecting charr and trout populations and food webs in cold-water lakes. (1) Lakes that are situated at high altitudes and/or are isolated typically have simple food webs due to species-poor communities (often only charr or trout) and limited availability of pelagic and terrestrial carbon and nutrient sources. High intraspecific competition can lead to niche expansion of charr and trout populations. Charr may also shift to cannibalism, which increases food web complexity. (2) Littoral benthic production usually dominates the primary and secondary production in clear and oligotrophic cold-water lakes. Hence, in allopatric lakes, charr and trout populations typically rely heavily on benthic food resources. In contrast, the sympatric populations of charr and trout often segregate to pelagic/profundal and littoral benthic trophic niches, respectively, to reduce resource competition. (3) Larger and deeper lakes at lower altitudes have a higher diversity of food resources, habitats and species, leading to more complex food webs and longer food chains. With increasing lake area, charr shifts to pelagic resources. Larger lakes may also facilitate the development of ecologically distinct morphs of the same species, such as profundal small benthivorous and/or large piscivorous morphs of charr.
