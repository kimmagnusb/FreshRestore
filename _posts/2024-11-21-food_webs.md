Several FreshRestore partners contributed to a recently published review paper describing the environmental and anthropogenic drivers of food webs and fish populations in cold-water lakes situated in high latitudes and altitudes.  
Drawing on a synthesis of existing literature, the paper focuses on three pivotal drivers:  
1. Lake location and connectivity  
2. Lake area and morphometry  
3. Fish community composition  

These drivers significantly influence the complexity and the origin and flow of energy in lake food webs, and ultimately the size structure of the charr and trout populations. Furthermore, the paper highlights ongoing environmental changes in Fennoscandian cold-water lakes caused by hydropower and invasive species. Finally, the paper identifies crucial knowledge gaps and proposes management actions for improving the future state of Fennoscandian cold-water lake ecosystems and their charr and trout populations.
