The Spanish partners, lead by [Javier](https://kimmagnusb.github.io/FreshRestore/team/#Javier+S%C3%A1nchez+Hern%C3%A1ndez), had a press release and radio interview in September. Good to see that people show interest in the important topics of our project. The lakes in Spain represent fragile ecosystems that experiences increasing stress with the ongoing climate change and other anthropogenic stressors such as the introduction of invasive species. 
Members of the FreshRestore consortium are always interested in talking more about our project, so please get in contact to get more information.
