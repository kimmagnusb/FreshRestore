    Kim Magnus is a freshwater ecologist with a special interest in understanding anthropogenic effects on the population dynamics of fishes. He is also involved in a range of other projects including incidental bycatch of seabirds, invasive freshwater species and solutions for migration barriers in streams. 
    On his spare time he enjoys fishing, biking, traveling and hiking. 
    In FreshRestore, Kim Magnus will lead WP 1, and have the role of PI.

    Antti Eloranta (https://sites.google.com/view/antti-p-eloranta/front-page) is working as an Academy of Finland Research Fellow at the University of Jyväskylä, Finland. His new research group investigates natural variation in and human impacts on salmonid fish populations and food webs in Fennoscandian freshwater ecosystems.
    In the FreshRestore project, Antti Eloranta & co will compile stable isotope data from >100 Fennoscandian lakes to investigate the structure and function of lake food webs along large biogeographical gradients (WP3). 
    He will also contribute to the development of nature-based solutions for mitigation of negative human impacts on European freshwaters (WP5).
    In his spare time, Antti enjoys fishing, hiking, cooking and music.

- name: Javier Sánchez Hernández
  role: WP-leader

  description: >
    Javier is a freshwater ecologist with a main research interest in fish trophic ecology, including competitive interactions, food-web modelling, ontogenetic diet trajectories, niche variation and biogeographic patterns in feeding.
    The research touches on a wide variety of aspects of trophic ecology theory including, for example, the exploration of competitive coexistence principles through food resource partitioning to understand stability and functioning of animal assemblages and ecosystems.
    Javier will lead WP 3, in collaboration with Antti, as well as contribute to the development of nature-based solutions for mitigation of negative human impacts on European freshwaters (WP5).
