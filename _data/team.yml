    Kim Magnus is a freshwater ecologist with a special interest in understanding anthropogenic effects on the population dynamics of fishes. He is also involved in a range of other projects including incidental bycatch of seabirds, invasive freshwater species and solutions for migration barriers in streams. 
    On his spare time he enjoys fishing, biking, traveling and hiking. 
    In FreshRestore, Kim Magnus will lead WP 1, and have the role of PI.

- name: Antti P. Eloranta
  role: WP-leader

  description: >
    <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/antti-p-eloranta/front-page">Antti Eloranta</a> is working as an Academy of Finland Research Fellow at the University of Jyväskylä, Finland. His new research group investigates natural variation in and human impacts on salmonid fish populations and food webs in Fennoscandian freshwater ecosystems.
    In the FreshRestore project, Antti Eloranta & co will compile stable isotope data from >100 Fennoscandian lakes to investigate the structure and function of lake food webs along large biogeographical gradients (WP3). 
    He will also contribute to the development of nature-based solutions for mitigation of negative human impacts on European freshwaters (WP5).
    In his spare time, Antti enjoys fishing, hiking, cooking and music.

- name: Javier Sánchez Hernández
  role: WP-leader
  image: assets/theme/Picture1.jpg
  description: >
    Javier is a freshwater ecologist with a main research interest in fish trophic ecology, including competitive interactions, food-web modelling, ontogenetic diet trajectories, niche variation and biogeographic patterns in feeding.
    The research touches on a wide variety of aspects of trophic ecology theory including, for example, the exploration of competitive coexistence principles through food resource partitioning to understand stability and functioning of animal assemblages and ecosystems.
    Javier will lead WP 3, in collaboration with Antti, as well as contribute to the development of nature-based solutions for mitigation of negative human impacts on European freshwaters (WP5).

- name: Pär Byström
  role: WP-leader
  image: assets/theme/pelle_site.jpg
  description: >
    Pär Byström is an aquatic ecologist with main research interest in the consequences of ontogenetic niche shifts for size-structured trophic interactions. His present research focus on how natural variation and anthropogenic changes 
    in habitat/niche specific productivity impact lake fish population dynamics, species interactions and population size structure, using a combination of field studies and population modelling. On his spare time Pär enjoys ski touring, fishing, hunting and cooking. 
    Pär will lead WP 2, in collaboration with Kim Magnus, and contribute to the development of nature-based solutions for mitigation of negative human impacts on European freshwaters (WP5).

- name: Ignasi Arranz Urgell
  role: Postdoc
  image: assets/theme/ignasi.png
  description: >
    Ignasi Arranz is a postdoctoral researcher interested in biodiversity science, and ecosystem functioning, especially in the context of global change over freshwater ecosystems. In general, his research is divided into three main lines: 
    (1) a trophic ecology research studying aquatic food webs, (2) community ecology research studying patterns of diversity over spatiotemporal gradients, and (3) a biological conservation research for the preservation of biodiversity loss and developing management strategies. 
    In FreshRestore, Ignasi will closely work with Javier in the WP3 in the comparative study among ecosystems at different latitudinal gradients. Visit his <a href="https://www.ignasiarranz.com/">webpage</a> for more information on his main interests.

- name: Matthew Cobain 
  role: Postdoc
  image: assets/theme/Cobain_ProfPic.jpg
  description: >
    Mat, based at Jyväskylä University, is a stable isotope ecologist whose research has predominantly focused on quantifying the structure and functioning of fish communities. He is currently developing improved Bayesian spatial models to understand
    and map the drivers that underpin isotopic landscapes. In FreshRestore, he will be working closely with Antti Eloranta in WP3 to try and understand the prevailing environmental drivers of lake food-web structures across Fennoscandia through stable isotopes.
    If you can't find him in the office, lab or field, then he will probably be on the badminton court.

  role: Postdoc

  description: >
    Ossi is a postdoctoral freshwater ecologist working at the Univeristy of Jyväskylä. He has previously worked with anthropogenic impacts on freshwater food web functioning and biomolecule contents of different organism across the food webs. In FreshRestore
    project he will be comparing secondary consumer allochtony models based on Bayesian and simple linear approaches. Ossi will be working mainly with Antti Eloranta (WP3) with this subproject where the main goal is to better understand which environmental factors
    are driving consumer dependence on terrestrial energy sources.

- name: Wojciech Uszko 
  role: Postdoc
  image: assets/theme/wojciech_photo.jpg
  description: >
   Wojciech is a postdoctoral researcher based at Umeå University. He uses dynamic models, experiments and field data to study warming effects on aquatic food web dynamics and community size structure.
   In FreshRestore, together with Pär Byström he is involved in WP2, where he is developing physiologically-structured population models (PSPMs) to look at the effects of lake and stream habitat characteristics
   as well as global change pressures on fish population abundance, dynamics and size structure.
